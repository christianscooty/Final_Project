# Outline


I am interested in finding how COVID has affected the crime rates within New York city. I would use two datasets from the NYS open data website. The first stage of the project would be combining the datasets by the date. Then, I could perform a time-series analysis. First, I would plot the crime and COVID case trends on custom a visualization to see how they interplay. I would also compare last year’s crime data to the current year’s to understand the changes (if any).
